# MIGAN

Abstract:
We proposed a robust GAN-based multiple imputation method, MIGAN, for blockwise general pattern missing data. 
MIGAN could work under MAR mechanism with theoretical support and significantly improved the statistical inference 
performance in the high dimensional setting compared with other MAR methods like MIWAE, optimal transport-based 
methods etc.
